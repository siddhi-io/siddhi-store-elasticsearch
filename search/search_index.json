Features elasticsearch ( Store ) Elasticsearch store implementation uses Elasticsearch indexing document for underlying data storage. The events are converted to Elasticsearch index documents when the events are inserted into the elasticsearch store. Elasticsearch indexing documents are converted to events when the documents are read from Elasticsearch indexes. The internal store is connected to the Elastisearch server via the Elasticsearch Java High Level REST Client library. Prerequisites Elasticsearch can be downloaded directly from href=\"https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch\" in zip, tar.gz, deb, or rpm packages. Then install the version 6.2.4, usual Ubuntu way with dpkg. sudo apt-get update wget https://download.elastic.co/elasticsearch/release/org/elasticsearch/distribution/deb/elasticsearch/6.2.4/elasticsearch-6.2.4.deb sudo dpkg -i elasticsearch-6.2.4.deb How To Install and Configure Elasticsearch on Ubuntu 16.04 - Also you can start the Elasticsearch server using docker image: docker run -p 9600:9200 -p 9700:9300 -e \"discovery.type=single-node\" -e ELASTIC_PASSWORD=MagicWord -d docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.2.4 Dependencies There are no other dependencies needed for this extension. Installation For installing this extension on various siddhi execution environments refer Siddhi documentation section on adding extensions . Support and Contribution We encourage users to ask questions and get support via StackOverflow , make sure to add the siddhi tag to the issue for better response.

The connection is made as specified by the parameters configured for the '@Store' annotation. The 'symbol' attribute is considered a unique field and an Elasticsearch index document ID is generated for it. EXAMPLE 2 @Store(type=\"elasticsearch\", host=\"localhost\", username=\"elastic\", password=\"changeme\", index.name=\"MyStockTable\", field.length=\"symbol:100\", bulk.actions=\"5000\", bulk.size=\"1\", concurrent.requests=\"2\", flush.interval=\"1\", backoff.policy.retry.no=\"3\", backoff.policy.wait.time=\"1\", ssl.enabled=\"true\", trust.store.type=\"jks\", trust.store.path=\"/User/wso2/wso2sp/resources/security/client-truststore.jks\", trust.store.pass=\"wso2carbon\") @PrimaryKey(\"symbol\")define table StockTable (symbol string, price float, volume long); This example uses SSL to connect to Elasticsearch. EXAMPLE 3 @Store(type=\"elasticsearch\", elasticsearch.member.list=\"https://hostname1:9200,https://hostname2:9200\", username=\"elastic\", password=\"changeme\", index.name=\"MyStockTable\", field.length=\"symbol:100\", bulk.actions=\"5000\", bulk.size=\"1\", concurrent.requests=\"2\", flush.interval=\"1\", backoff.policy.retry.no=\"3\", backoff.policy.wait.time=\"1\") @PrimaryKey(\"symbol\")define table StockTable (symbol string, price float, volume long); This example defined several elasticsearch members to publish data using elasticsearch.member.list parameter.","title":"elasticsearch (Store)"}]}
